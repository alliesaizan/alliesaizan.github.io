My name is Allie Saizan, and I am a data scientist at a consulting firm near our nation’s capital. My background is in economics (a field in which I have Bachelor's and Master’s degrees) and in a prior life I was a researcher working with labor economists at a federally funded research and development center. I am also active in the Data Science for Social Good community, where I am currently a volunteer with the [COVID-19 Community Insight and Impact project](ttps://github.com/community-insight-impact).


In the data science world, I am most interested in traditional supervised machine learning methods and natural language processing (NLP). Many of my personal projects reflect an interest in NLP. This interest also extends to ML bias, specifically *representational harms* caused by gender and racial bias in words embeddings and language models.

Please reference my [Github profile](https://github.com/alliesaizan) to view my portfolio of work. My CV can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQTjAwbmRfpbJZgljWxkHGEsKDsl1YtBo7Oc335Z-YiE1dWgRA0Pf6vxS29n-M917fkm0aKD2f5F5PD/pub).

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, playing video games, and needlecrafts (these days, cross stitch). I also enjoy spending time with my cat, Mila, pictured below. If you're wondering where the name of this blog originates, it is a throwback to my hometown (New Orleans), and particularly to the song "When the Saints Come Marching In."

This blog is a work in progress, and as I improve my web development skills, the site will have additional functionality.
